A user-friendly **URL Shortener Application** built with **React.js**, designed to shorten long URLs, provide analytics, and handle redirection — all within the client-side application.

## 🚀 Features

- **Mandatory Logging Integration**  
  - Uses custom Logging Middleware (no console logging or inbuilt loggers).
- **React-Based Architecture**  
  - Fully implemented using React.js.
- **Authentication-Free Access**  
  - APIs are pre-authorized. No registration/login required.
- **Unique Short Links**  
  - Ensures all generated short links are unique and managed properly.
- **Default Validity**  
  - If no validity is specified, links expire in **30 minutes**.
- **Custom Shortcodes**  
  - Users can provide a custom shortcode (alphanumeric, reasonable length).  
  - If not provided, the app generates one automatically.
- **Redirection**  
  - Handles client-side routing. Redirects shortened URLs back to the original long URLs.
